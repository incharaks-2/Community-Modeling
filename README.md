# Community-Modeling
Defining Dysbiosis and Health for Community Scale Modeling.
Individual microbe's metabolic models for community building are downloaded from AGORA2 repository in Virtual Human Database.
Individual microbes's metabolic models are constrained by providing Average Human Diet (AHD) media using COBRApy package in Jupyter notebook 7 and gurobi solver.
Community metabolic models are built and analysed for optimal biomass and Flux space variation under diffrent community combinations and fixed abunfance using PyCoMo package in Jupyter notebook 7 with gurobi solver.
